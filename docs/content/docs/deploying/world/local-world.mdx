title: Local World
---

The Local World is bundled with `workflow` and used automatically during local development. No installation or configuration required.

To explicitly use the local world in any environment, set the environment variable:

```bash
WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=local
```

## Observability

The `workflow` CLI uses the local world by default. Running these commands inside your workflow project will show your local development workflows:

```bash
# List recent workflow runs
npx workflow inspect runs

# Launch the web UI
npx workflow web
```

Learn more in the [Observability](/docs/observability) documentation.

## Testing & Performance

<WorldTestingPerformance />

## Configuration

The local world works with zero configuration, but you can customize behavior through environment variables or programmatically via `createLocalWorld()`.

### `WORKFLOW_LOCAL_DATA_DIR`

Directory for storing workflow data as JSON files. Default: `.workflow-data/`

### `PORT`

The application dev server port. Used to enqueue steps and workflows. Default: auto-detected

### `WORKFLOW_LOCAL_BASE_URL`

Full base URL override for HTTPS or custom hostnames. Default: `http://localhost:{port}`

Port resolution priority: `baseUrl` > `port` > `PORT` > auto-detected

### `WORKFLOW_LOCAL_QUEUE_CONCURRENCY`

Maximum number of concurrent queue workers. Default: `100`

### Programmatic configuration

{/* @skip-typecheck: incomplete code sample */}
```typescript title="workflow.config.ts" lineNumbers
import { createLocalWorld } from "@workflow/world-local";

const world = createLocalWorld({
  dataDir: "./custom-workflow-data",
  port: 5173,
  // baseUrl overrides port if set
  baseUrl: "https://local.example.com:3000",
});
```

## Limitations

The local world is designed for development, not production:

- **In-memory queue** - Steps are queued in memory and do not persist across server restarts
- **Filesystem storage** - Data is stored in local JSON files
- **Single instance** - Cannot handle distributed deployments
- **No authentication** - Suitable only for local development

For production deployments, use the [Vercel World](/worlds/vercel) or [Postgres World](/worlds/postgres).
