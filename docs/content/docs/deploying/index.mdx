Workflows are designed to be highly portable. The same workflow code can run locally during development, on Vercel with zero configuration, or on any infrastructure using **Worlds** — pluggable adapters that handle storage, queuing, and communication.

## Local Development

During local development, workflows automatically use the **Local World** — no configuration required. The Local World stores workflow data in a `.workflow-data/` directory and processes steps synchronously, making it perfect for development and testing.

```bash
# Just run your dev server - workflows work out of the box
npm run dev
```

You can inspect local workflow data using the CLI:

```bash
npx workflow inspect runs
```

## Deploying to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy workflows to production is on Vercel. When you deploy to Vercel, workflows automatically use the **Vercel World** — again, with zero configuration.

The Vercel World provides:

- **Durable storage** - Workflow state persists across function invocations
- **Managed queuing** - Steps are processed reliably with automatic retries
- **Automatic scaling** - Workflows scale with your application
- **Built-in observability** - View workflow runs in the Vercel dashboard

Simply deploy your application:

```bash
vercel deploy
```

## Self-Hosting & Other Providers

For self-hosting or deploying to other cloud providers, you can use community-maintained Worlds or build your own.

### Using a Third-Party World

To use a different World implementation, set the `WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD` environment variable:

```bash
export WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=@workflow-worlds/postgres
# Plus any world-specific configuration
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
```

Each World may have its own configuration requirements — refer to the specific World's documentation for details.

## Observability

The [Observability tools](/docs/observability) work with any World backend. By default they connect to your local environment, but can be configured to inspect remote deployments:

```bash
# Inspect local workflows
npx workflow inspect runs

# Inspect remote workflows
npx workflow inspect runs --backend @workflow-worlds/postgres
```
